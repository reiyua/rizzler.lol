<h2>Entry #1: Main Domain Hijack Attempt (3/09/2024)</h2>

<p>Well, you weren't very smart in trying to hijack my domain for your scummy scam within my Google Search Console account.</p>

<p>Specifically, you tried to make my domain to this scummy website pictured below:</p>

<p>You specifically used THESE two email addresses for these two hijack requests:</p>

<ul>
<li>vionaliliana533@gmail.com</li>
<img src="email_1.png" alt="Viona Liliana" />
<li>service-account@credible-nation-433122-m8.iam.gserviceaccount.com</li>
<img src="email_2.png" alt="Service Account" />
</ul>

<h2>Entry #2: Merchant listings structured data issues detected in rizzler.lol (3/09/2024)</h2>

<p>These TWO new emails appeared out of nowhere in my inbox regarding the hijack attempt:</p>

<img src="email_3.png" alt="New Product snippets structured data issues detected for rizzler.lol" />
<img src="email_4.png" alt="Merchant listings structured data issues detected in rizzler.lol" />

<p>I really am not sure what you are trying to get at with this scam, but rest assured:</p>
