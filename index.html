<h1>Not what you are expecting huh?</h1>

<p>Well, you weren't very smart in trying to hijack my domain for your scummy scam within my Google Search Console account.</p>

<p>Specifically, you tried to make my domain to this scummy website pictured below:</p>

<img src="dodgy_site.png" alt="Dodgy Scam Site" />

<p>You specifically used THESE two email addresses for these two hijack requests:</p>

<ul>
<li>vionaliliana533@gmail.com</li>
<img src="email_1.png" alt="Viona Liliana" />
<li>service-account@credible-nation-433122-m8.iam.gserviceaccount.com</li>
<img src="email_2.png" alt="Service Account" />
</ul>

<p>I really am not sure what you are trying to get at with this scam, but rest assured:</p>
